# History

## 0.10.0 (2024-03-30)

- Added Python-side support for JS Promises. You can now return a JS Promise from code
    executed by `MiniRacer.eval`, and PyMiniRacer will convert it to a Python object
    which has a blocking `promise.get()` method, and also supports `await promise` in
    `async` Python functions.

- Added a `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`. These common functions live in the Web API
    standard, not the ECMAScript standard, and thus don't come with V8, but they're so
    ubiquitious we now ship an implemention with `PyMiniRacer`.

## 0.9.0 (2024-03-30)

- Revamped JS execution model to be out-of-thread. Python/C++ interaction now happens
    via callbacks. 

- Consequently, Control+C (`KeyboardInterrupt`) now interrupts JS execution.

- Hardened C++-side thread safety model, resolving potential race conditions introduced
    in v0.8.1 (but not actually reported as happening anywhere).

- Further improved JS exception reporting; exception reports now show the offending code
    where possible.

- Introduced `timeout_sec` parameter to `eval`, `call`, and `execute` to replace the
    `timeout`, which unfortunately uses milliseconds (unlike the Python standard
    library). In the future we may emit deprecation warnings for use of `timeout`.

## 0.8.1 (2024-03-23)

- A series of C++ changes which should not impact the behavior of PyMiniRacer:
- Refactoring how we use V8 by inverting the control flow. Before we had function
    evaluations which ran and drained the message loop. Now we have an always-running
    message loop into which we inject function evaluations. This seems to be the
    preferred way to use V8. This is not expected to cause any behavior changes (but, in
    tests, makes
    [microtask competion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide)
    more consistent).
- Refactoring the C++ implementation into multiple components to make startup and
    teardown logic more robust.
- Added tests for the existing fast-function-call path.
- Also, simplified Python conversion of C++ evaluation results.

## 0.8.0 (2024-03-18)

- General overhaul of C++ implementation to better adhere to modern best practice. This
    should have no visible impact except for the following notes...
- Exposed the hard memory limit as a context-specific (as opposed to `eval`-specific)
    limit, since that's how it worked all along anyway. The `max_memory` `eval` argument
    still works for backwards compatibility purposes.
- Correct message type of some exceptions to `str` instead of `bytes` (they should all
    be `str` now).
- Added better messages for JS parse errors.
- Added backtraces for more JS errors.
- Added some really basic Python typing.

## 0.7.0 (2024-03-06)

- Update V8 to 12.2
- Drop Python 2 support
- Fix small Python 3.12 issue and add testing for Python 3.9-3.12
- Add aarch64 support for Mac and Linux
- Revamp DLL loading to be compliant with Python 3.9-style resource loading. This may
    present a small breaking change for advanced usage; the `EXTENSION_PATH` and
    `EXTENSION_NAME` module variables, and `MiniRacer.v8_flags` and `MiniRacer.ext`
    class variable have all been removed.
- Add support for the [ECMAScript internalization API](https://v8.dev/docs/i18n) and
    thus [the ECMA `Intl` API](https://tc39.es/ecma402/) 
- Use [fast startup snapshots](https://v8.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots)
- Switch from setuptools to Hatch
- Switch from tox to Hatch
- Switch from flake8 and isort to Hatch's wrapper of Ruff
- Switch from Sphinx to mkdocs (and hatch-mkdocs)
